# CV Parser Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Name Extraction Bug
**Problem**: The name column was extracting incorrect information like "Second Class", "Nigerian Law", "Life Mission" instead of actual names.

**Root Cause**: 
- Simple regex patterns that matched any capitalized words
- No validation to exclude common non-name words
- No proper cleaning of extracted names

**Solution**:
- Implemented more sophisticated name detection logic that looks for proper name patterns (2-4 words with proper capitalization)
- Added validation to exclude common non-name words like 'cv', 'resume', 'university', 'second class', etc.
- Added `clean_name()` method to properly format names with correct capitalization
- Improved name extraction to look at the first few lines of the document where names typically appear
- Added fallback patterns for different CV formats

### 2. Phone Number Extraction Bug
**Problem**: Phone numbers were not extracting the full number for some CVs, showing incomplete results like "+234 8144642" instead of complete numbers.

**Root Cause**:
- Limited regex patterns that didn't cover all international formats
- No handling for Nigerian phone number formats specifically
- No cleaning of extracted phone numbers

**Solution**:
- Added comprehensive phone number patterns including:
  - Nigerian format: `+234 XXX XXX XXXX`
  - Nigerian format with 4-digit groups: `+234 XXX XXXX XXXX`
  - US format: `+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX`
  - International formats: `+XX XXXX XXXX XXXX`
  - Simple formats: `XXX-XXX-XXXX`
  - 11-digit numbers common in many countries
- Added `clean_phone_number()` method to:
  - Remove duplicate country codes
  - Normalize whitespace
  - Clean up formatting
- Implemented logic to select the longest/most complete phone number when multiple matches are found

### 3. University Name Extraction Bug
**Problem**: University names were not extracting the full university name, showing incomplete information.

**Root Cause**:
- Basic keyword matching that only captured single lines
- No context gathering from surrounding lines
- No cleaning of extracted university names

**Solution**:
- Enhanced university extraction to capture multi-line university names
- Added logic to combine current line with surrounding lines for context
- Added "law school" to university keywords
- Implemented `clean_university_name()` method to:
  - Remove date patterns (e.g., "2018-2022", "Nov. 2023")
  - Remove location suffixes
  - Normalize whitespace
- Added validation to exclude lines containing contact information
- Implemented candidate selection to choose the most complete university name

### 4. University Grade Extraction Bug
**Problem**: Grade information was not extracting the full details, showing incomplete grade information.

**Root Cause**:
- Limited regex patterns that didn't cover all grade formats
- No handling for international grading systems
- No cleaning of extracted grades

**Solution**:
- Expanded grade patterns to include:
  - GPA formats: `3.5 GPA`, `3.5/4.0`
  - Percentage formats: `85%`
  - Letter grades: `A+`, `B-`, etc.
  - International classifications: `Second Class Upper`, `First Class Honours`, `Third Class`
  - Other formats: `Distinction`, `Merit`, `Credit`, `Pass Class`
- Implemented `clean_grade()` method to:
  - Standardize common grade formats
  - Normalize whitespace
  - Ensure consistent formatting
- Added support for both tuple and string matches from regex

## Additional Improvements

### Code Organization
- Added separate cleaning methods for each data type
- Improved code readability and maintainability
- Added comprehensive error handling

### Robustness
- Better validation of extracted data
- Improved handling of edge cases
- More comprehensive regex patterns

### Data Quality
- Consistent formatting of extracted data
- Removal of common artifacts and noise
- Better handling of multi-line information

## Testing
Created `test_extraction.py` to verify the improvements work correctly with sample data.

## Usage
The improved CV parser now provides much more accurate extraction of:
- **Names**: Properly formatted full names
- **Phone Numbers**: Complete international phone numbers
- **University Names**: Full university names without date/location artifacts
- **Grades**: Complete grade information in standardized format

All extracted data is now properly cleaned and formatted for consistent CSV output.
